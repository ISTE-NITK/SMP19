The output of the given question is 
[0,1]
[3,2,1,0,1,4]
[0,1,0,1,4]
initally the list is empty and when the function gfg(2) is called it adds [0,1] to the empty list via the for loop similarly when gfg(3,[3,2,1]) is called the for loop appends the 0,1,4 to the end of the list passed so the output becomes[3,2,1,0,1,4].In the next case when we call the function via gfg(3) we get the output as [0,1,0,1,4] as the l=[] points to the same object which was initially set to [0,1] in the first function call.
