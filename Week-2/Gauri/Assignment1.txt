1)	Output:
        [‘1’,’S’,’T’,’E’]    (Changes made to list2 will be reflected onto list1 since list2 = list1)
        [‘1’,’S’,’T’,’E’]
        If line5 is replaced with list1+=[], then output will be
        [‘1’,2,’T’,’E’]
        (This is because list1 = list1 + [] will add one item to the list, while list1 += [] will copy all elements of right-hand-side list into the left-hand-side list.)

2)	#Program to sort a list
        nlist = [9,8,7,6,5,4,1]
        nlist.sort()
        print(nlist)

       #Program to search for an element in a sorted list

       from bisect import bisect_left 
  
       def BinarySearch(a, x): 
       i = bisect_left(a, x) 
       if i != len(a) and a[i] == x: 
        print(i)
       else: 
        print(-1)



3)	Output:
        False (id(l1)!=id(l2))
        True (id(str1)=id(str2))
   
4)	#Assume that the given list C is a then new list b is defined as
        D = [x for x in range(len(C)) if x*x*x % 3 == 1] 
        #D now contains all elements of C whose cubes % 3 = 1
