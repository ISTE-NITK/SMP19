yes there is a change in the output 

in the first case the output will be ['1','s','t','e']
				     ['1','s','t','e']

in the modified case the output will be ['1','s','t','e']
					['1','2','t','e']


the reason is : in the first case list1 = list1 + [] will create a new object for list1 and i the second case list1+=[] a new object is not created so the change is reflected in list1
