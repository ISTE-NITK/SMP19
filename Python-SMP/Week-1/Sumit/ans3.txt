	In case of lists python creates a new object everytime for every variable with different address.
	But in case of strings it creates a string and assigns it's address to the variable. So, even if we
	create two variables they both will point to the same string. If we change the value of variable it will
	not change the string instead it will create another string and assign that address to the variable.
